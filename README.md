### Usage

**Beware of using the dev branch and uploading it to any markets, in many cases it not will work as expected**.

First of all, take a look at **src/main/java/org/telegram/messenger/BuildVars.java** and fill it with correct values.
Import the root folder into your IDE (tested on Android Studio), then run project.
